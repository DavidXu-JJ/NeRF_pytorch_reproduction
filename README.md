Reference:[nerf](https://github.com/bmild/nerf), [nerf-pytorch](https://github.com/yenchenlin/nerf-pytorch), [NeRF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.08934.pdf)

Thanks a lot to the author's patient explanation in nerf's issues.

[My detailed reading note](https://davidxu-jj.github.io/blog/NeRF/NeRF.html) of NeRF and its code. Hope it can help you anyway.

## The output video

Notice: I didn't run the whole training epoch. Because I just want to justify my code. The following video is generated after 50k iterations.
